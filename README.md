# 4. Customer Segmentation
The workforce pay rates and gender data from Vancouver enables a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis through multiple data aspects. Gender statistics in different job sections including Construction, Trades and Equipment Operators show inconsistencies between worker numbers and wage levels. The examination of minimum and maximum hourly earnings creates occupational segments which demonstrate possible differences in wages according to salary categories between genders. The time frame across five consecutive years (2019â€“2023) allows researchers to track workforce trends that reflect gender representation evolution during that period. Public organizations maintain separate categories for positions which reveal differences between 'Exempt' and 'Union' classification systems. This segmentation system delivers essential workforce understanding about Vancouver's workforce structure which lets stakeholders detect gender balance improvement areas and guide workplace diversity policy development.

Data quality rules were applied to the dataset to ensure its integrity:
Completeness: We ensured that the "Status" column had at least 50% non-null values.
Uniqueness: We validated that the "Location" column had at least 13% unique values. This step checks for duplicates or inconsistencies, improving the accuracy of the dataset.
A Conditional Router transformation was employed to segment the data based on validation outcomes:
Pass Folder: Data that met all the quality criteria was routed here for further processing.
Fail Folder: Data that failed to meet the necessary criteria was routed here for further review or exclusion.
We modified the schemas for both the pass and fail datasets to ensure compatibility with their respective destination folders. This is crucial for maintaining a structured and organized data flow.
The processed data was then uploaded to the S3 bucket, ensuring a clear distinction between validated and unvalidated data.
